### ok-zoomer
A very hacky extension for [GMEdit](https://github.com/YellowAfterlife/GMEdit) by [YellowAfterlife](https://yal.cc), that allows you to upscale the GUI of the editor.

The scaling level can be set in preferences, under the `ok-zoomer` plugin.

This was made in about an hour, and has barely been tested. Use at your own risk!
